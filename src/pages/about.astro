	<p>
		I am a <strong>Centrist Revisionist</strong> (Social-Liberal, certified) who occasionally switches to an anarchist mindset when my core values are challenged. I am a staunch advocate for digital freedom, open-source collaboration, environmental sustainability, and the profound elegance found in <strong>silence and asynchronous workflows</strong>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		By profession, I "bake cakes" (build engineering logic and structural protocols) in the <strong>FMT (Facility Management Technology)</strong> industry. My current trajectory involves a deep transition between Engineering and Industrial paradigms (E&I transition), always seeking the absolute architecture hidden beneath the surface of complex systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		I describe myself as a <strong>135° Youth</strong>—an angle that represents my refusal to align with traditional polarities. I am a chronic patient of <em>Chunibyo</em> (ちゅうにびょう), finding meaning in the "stream of consciousness" rather than the mundane "West Coast" patterns. I have a severe case of "厭蠢症" (Aversion to stupidity), cured only by the precision of factual analysis and the relentless pursuit of truth.
	</p>

		"I'm volatile, self-obsessed, and don't play well with others."

	<p>
		As a <strong>Factual Obsessive</strong>, I don't follow the crowd. I don't engage in meaningless debates with the shallow or the closed-minded. If you're looking for an objective perspective or a cold splash of reality, you've found the right place. I believe in passion, heat, and the invariant echoes that connect the underlying protocols of history to the future order.

		I am <span class="text-foreground font-semibold">S'ALL Running Man</span>. In this endless marathon, I deconstruct archives and engineering limits to capture the signals within the noise.
